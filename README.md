# Casual_Creator
Computational Creativity Mission 9: Another Kind of CC. The goal of this mission is to gain experience with the Processing programming language and design and build your own casual creator.
# Bubble Buds

A brief overview for your project that includes answers to the brainstorming questions: (1) what are your users casually creating, (2) how do you keep them engaged and excited to create, and (3) how do you help them make something they are proud to share.
### What are users creating?
Using Bubbled, users write have the ability to customize messages. As users type, the message appears horizontally across the screen, and colorful bubbles with the letters from their message bounce randomly around the canvas. Users are able to pause and slowly step through the bubbles progress, change the colors of the message and background, edit the font, and restart creating with ease. 

### How do I aim to keep users engaged and excited to create?
Written words are often very personal. Users can make creative works with the words of their choosing. Users can choose what they want to say, but it's just the right amount of challenge to acheive the right combination of colors/fonts and tostop the bubbles in the correct place. It is continuaously surprising because users cannot anticipate the bubbles movements; Each time one touches an edge it chages it's velocity on the canvas. It is also continuously surprising through the randomly generated fonts and color combinations. There are seemingly endless combinations. Users can also choose the level of sponteneity; They can slowly step through the program to get exactly what they want, or they can quickly flip through lots of random options. Users can reach a state of flow (or "be in the zone") when they are walking through the program to get exactly what they want. They also may experiance an "energized focus" where they are "fully immersed" when attempting to pause it at just the right moment as the bubbles move at full speed. The personalized messages make it valuable to the user, and the sponteneity keeps them engaged and excited to create.

### How do I help make something users are proud to share?
As stated before, written words can often be very personal, and convey a lot a meaning. Being able to write short, meaningful messages is a skill, and Bubble Buds is a platform that offers a creative way to share these messages. Users can also be proud of their artistic eye (and potentially their pausing skills). There is some aspect of luck involved, but to spend the time and pick a combination of colors, bubble configureation, and font that is appealing to the individual requires time and thought - which is something to be proud of.

## How to run the code?
To run the processing sketch on it's own, download the proccessing 

## Documentation of bugs
Document bugs in your code, if any. (Ideally, you would have no bugs in your final project submission to obtain a perfect score. However, if you find that you have last-minute bugs, it is far better to document them in your README than to have your users discover them on their own.)
