# Bubbled

A brief overview for your project that includes answers to the brainstorming questions: (1) what are your users casually creating, (2) how do you keep them engaged and excited to create, and (3) how do you help them make something they are proud to share.

## Documentation of bugs
Document bugs in your code, if any. (Ideally, you would have no bugs in your final project submission to obtain a perfect score. However, if you find that you have last-minute bugs, it is far better to document them in your README than to have your users discover them on their own.)
